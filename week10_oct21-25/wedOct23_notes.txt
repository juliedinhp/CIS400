Milestone 8: extended to Sunday, October 27
    (Milestone 7 and 8 are the biggest milestones of the course)


/////////////////////////

Data validation in WPF


<TextBox>
    <TextBox.Text>
        <Binding Path="SomePropertyName" Delay="500" UpdateSourceTrigger="PropertyChanged">
            <Binding.ValidationRules>
                <ExceptionValidationRule/>
            </Binding.ValidationRules>
        </Binding>
    </TextBox.Text>
</TextBox>


Idea: will put red marker around the TextBox if setting the property causes
    an exception (it will NOT try to do the set if what you enter
    doesn't match the property type)


Default "UpdateSourceTrigger" for a TextBox is when it loses focus
    --> we want to apply our data validation whenever the property changes
        (i.e., as the user types), so we make it be "PropertyChanged"

    --> the delay waits the given amount (here, 500ms) before setting the property
        (lets the user finish typing)

--> see similar example

--> what if we wanted the cost to show as $0.00 for an invalid #shirts?
