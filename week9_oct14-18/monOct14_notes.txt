Swapping controls and custom events tutorial: due Monday
Custom controls and resources tutorial: due Tuesday
Milestone 7: due Friday

--> quick look at Milestone 7 behavior (video is in Canvas)


////////////////////////////

One of the tricky parts: swapping controls

You will have several controls pre-loaded into the space where menu goes

Will update their Visibility with different actions (only one visible at a time)



Clicking a menu button (which is in the menu selection control)
should display the customization control for that item (which is in the main window)

    --> essentially, need to send a message from the menu (where the action is)
        to the MainWindow (where all the controls are stored)



///////////////////////////////

Steps to send message from one control to another.



Step 1: think about what information needs to be sent (might be nothing). If needed:
    - create a custom event args class that extends RoutedEventArgs
    - include the needed info as a property



Step 2: in the class where the action takes place:
    - declare a custom event whose type is your custom event args 
        (if no info needed, the type is RoutedEventArgs)

        public event EventHandler<CustomArgType>? EventName;



Step 3: whenever you want to send your message, invoke your custom event

        EventName?.Invoke(this, new CustomArgType(params));



Step 4: in the class where you want to handle the event, create an event handler
    for an event with those custom event args

    private void HandleCustomEvent(object? sender, CustomArgType e) {...}



Step 5: in the class where you want to handle the event, attach your custom
    event handler to the event from the control sending the message

    ControlName.EventName += HandleCustomEvent;


/////////////////

See example.

- MainWindow has a TextBlock named "ColorText" and a user-defined ColorControl
- ColorControl has RedButton (which is red) and BlueButton (which is blue)
    --> both have a Click event handler named ClickColor

--> goal: when we click the red button, want "Red" in the main windows TextBlock
    (and similar when we click the blue button)


///////////////////

Send info between menu selection and main window
    (send info about the item selected, main window should change what control is visible)

Custom event steps in MS7:
1) Make a custom event args class that extends RoutedEventArgs. It should
    contain the info needed about the event. (What is needed?)

    IMenuItem



2) Declare an event with your custom args in the class where the action will happen
    (where is this?) 

    menu selection control



3) Invoke your event (with the info in a new custom args) when the action happens
    (when would this be? How to get the info?)

    in the click event handler(s) for the different menu items



    if (button pressed was Chips) {
        order.Add(new Chips());
        CustomEvent?.Invoke(this, new CustomEventArgs(new Chips()));

        //is this the right idea?
        //only want ONE Chips instance, use in both order and event
    }



4) In the class where you want to make something happen, write an event handler 
    method that takes a sender and a custom args. Do whatever is needed.
    (where should the event handler be? what should it do?)

    MainWindow


    private void OnCustomize(object? sender, CustomEventArgs e) {
        //want to: display the matching customization control

        //get the IMenuItem from e

        //use selection statements to make the corresponding control visible

        //set that customization control's DataContext to be that IMenuItem

        //make all other customization controls (and menu control) hidden
    }


5) In the same class as #4, attach your event handler to the event in #2
    (where to do this?)

    MainWindow's constructor
    attach your custom event handler to your menu selection's event

    (will need to give menu selection control a name in the XAML)

/////////////////////

Recommended order of approach:


In Data:

1) Load your enums as custom resources (sizes, soda flavors, chip flavors, breads)


2) Mark that IMenuItem implements INotifyPropertyChanged


3) Declare PropertyChanged event in all parent classes (Entree, Drink, Side, Combo)


4) Put protected helper method in all abstract classes

    protected void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName)
    {
        this.PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
    }


5) In EACH menu item, call OnPropertyChanged(AffectedPropertyName) each
    time an action happens that would change the value of that property


    Examples?

        Cookies.
            CookieCount: CookieCount, Price, Calories, PreparationInformation
                do this in CookieCount set 
                    _cookieCount = value;
                    OnPropertyChanged(nameof(Price));
                    etc.
            Flavor: Flavor, Calories, PreparationInformation

        Apple.
            Sliced: Sliced, Price, PreparationInformation

            public bool Sliced {get; set;} = false;

            make our own private backing field
            expand out the get and the set

Next, in PointOfSale:


1) Create "helper" control with Name/Description/Calories

2) Pick an easy menu item - maybe Apple (will need to repeat with all)

3) Design a new user control for the menu item. 
    - load helper Name/Description/Calories control
    - include places to display/edit each customizable option

4) Preload your new control in MainWindow to the same spot as your menu selection
    (initially hidden)

5) Do the custom event handling as described so an event handler in MainWindow is   
    invoked when a menu item is clicked

6) Display your customization control and set its DataContext to the new item


--> get this done with ONE control first

--> will also need to handle order property changes when item properties change
    (see data binding tutorials - when we add an item, we 
    attach an event handler to the PropertyChanged for that item)

--> only need ONE Entree control (recommend doing last)

Wednesday:

- Discuss Entree control (limit size/bread choices in combo box)
- Discuss how to make subtotal/tax/total change when items are customized
