Milestone 7 due Friday

See Monday's notes for a suggested order of approach

////////////////////////////

How to make Order properties change when items are customized?

In Add, attach to item's PropertyChanged:

item.PropertyChanged += HandleOrderChanges;


--> how to write HandleOrderChanges?
    (sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs)

    (can check PropertyName of the args -- which one do we care about?)


--> what to do in Remove, Clear?



///////////////////////////////

Entree - custom lists for bread, size options

Add two properties:
    public IEnumerable<BreadType> BreadOptions

    public IEnumerable<SizeType> SizeOptions


How to implement?


In Entree customization control, add ComboBox
    ItemsSource is?
    SelectedItem is?



Updating (current) Bread, Size choice in Entree:
    What to do with PropertyChanged?

    FYI: update those sets to first make sure value is different than the
        current backing field (and return if not)

        Can cause stack overflow otherwise
