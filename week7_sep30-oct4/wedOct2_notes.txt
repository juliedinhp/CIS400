Next week:

- Two tutorials (Mon/Tues)
- Milestone 6 will be smaller, no UML/testing
    --> due next *Thursday*
    --> we will walk through much of it in class Mon/Wed
    --> idea is to help everyone through milestone to be
        able to enjoy 3-day weekend

(no class next Friday, October 11)

///////////////////////////

Friday: Milestone 5 due

--> see demo

//////

Types of layouts:
- StackPanel - all in a row or column
- DockPanel - dock things to left/right/top/bottom 
    if there is extra space, last added item fills space
- Grid - rows/columns

--> when to use each?

///////////////////////////

Creating menu control
    - what kind of layout?
    - what kind of controls will you have?
    - do you need to worry about spacing of other components?



/////

Creating order control
    - what kind of layout?
    - what kinds of controls will you have?
    
    - should contain a ListView

    <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding}"/>

    What does the "Binding" mean?


////

Creating the MainWindow.
    - how to lay out the menu and the order summary?
    - how to get the buttons on the bottom?

    Adding a custom control:

    <local:YourControlClass/>

    (can specify properties like Grid.Row, etc. as usual)


////

What is DataContext? How does it work? Where do we set it?
    ObservableCollection<IMenuItem>
    do this in the MainWindow constructor







How can we add items to the collection when we click buttons?
    need click event handler

    private void ClickEventHandler(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {
        if (sender is Button b) {
            if (DataContext is ObservableCollection<IMenuItem> order)
                if (b.Name == "CustomSandwichCtrl") {
                    order.Add(new CustomSandwich());
                }
            }
        }

    }
