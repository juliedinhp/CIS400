Next week:

- Two tutorials (Mon/Tues)
- Milestone 6 will be smaller, no UML/testing
    --> due next *Thursday*
    --> we will walk through much of it in class Mon/Wed
    --> idea is to help everyone through milestone to be
        able to enjoy 3-day weekend

(no class next Friday, October 11)

///////////////////////////

Friday: Milestone 5 due

--> see demo

//////

Types of layouts:
- StackPanel - in a line, vertically or horizontally
- DockPanel - dock elements to top/bottom/left/right
    fills extra space with last added element
- Grid - rows/columns

--> when to use each?

///////////////////////////

Creating menu control
    - what kind of layout?
    - what kind of controls will you have?
    - do you need to worry about spacing of other components?



/////

Creating order control
    - what kind of layout?
    - what kinds of controls will you have?
    
    - should contain a ListView

    <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding}"/>

    What does the "Binding" mean?


////

Creating the MainWindow.
    - how to lay out the menu and the order summary?
    - how to get the buttons on the bottom?

    Adding a custom control:

    <local:YourControlClass/>

    (can specify properties like Grid.Row, etc. as usual)


////

What is DataContext? How does it work? Where do we set it?
    ObservableCollection<IMenuItem>
    set in the MainWindow constructor


How can we add items to the collection when we click buttons?

assign names to all menu buttons in the XAML

private void ClickEventHandler(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {
    //sender is the button that was ClickEventHandler

    if (sender is Button b) {
        if (DataContext is ObservableCollection<IMenuItem> order)
            if (b.Name == "CustomSandwichCtrl") {
                order.Add(new CustomSandwich());
            }
        }
    }

    
}
