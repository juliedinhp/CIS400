Milestone 3 due Friday

--> be sure it builds!

///////////////////////////////

Continue with inheritance.

- what is there in common?

- how to refactor?

Milestone 3: refactoring your menu items

- IMenuItem interface

- IngredientType enum/IngredientItem class
    ingredient + name + calories + unit cost 
        + included bool + default bool
    --> why?
    --> setting "default" bool (should have "init" instead of "set")
    --> setting "included" bool
    --> unit cost?




//////////////////////////////

- Entree (abstract) class implements IMenuItem
    - Current bread choice, default bread type
    - Size choice
    - Collection of *possible* ingredients 
        - List<IngredientItem> OR
        - Dictionary<Ingredient, IngredientItem>

        --> should hold JUST possible ingredients for this entree

        protected List<IngredientItem> _possibleToppings = new();


        --> how to initialize? 





    - How are calories found for ALL subs/wraps/sandwiches?






    - General way to get preparation information
        --> how to do "Add ..." or "Hold ..."?



        --> how to do "Use ... Bread"?




    - General way to define price? price for all is first 
        calculated for a med., then scaled on size
        --> could have a protected MediumPrice property 
            that you override in each type
        --> then Entree's Price property could...?
        --> would you need to override Price?


        (if you want to make price abstract and override 
            in each specific case, that's OK too)



    - what can Entree do with the bread choice / 
    size choice requirements?


/////////////////////////////////////

- new: CustomSandwich class (extends Entree)
    --> default bread is wheat, size is med
    --> ALL ingredients are possible 
        (but none are included by default)
    --> how to find price of a medium?



- All specialty Sandwich/Sub/Wrap classes extend Entree
    --> Current bread = ? (where to initialize?) 
    --> Default bread = ? (where to initialize?) 
    --> Ingredients = ? (where to initialize?) 

    --> do we override Price, Calories, or PreparationInformation?  
    --> what happens to the size/bread choice properties?
    --> what happens to all the bool ingredients?





- Drink, Side are abstract, implement IMenuItem
    - Collect together shared info from drinks and sides
    - Make all drinks extend Drink, all sides extend Side
    - Identify common implementations - for all drinks, 
        we find cals/price for a medium 
        (and do this differently for different drinks) and then
        scale based on size

        --> how could we pull out the common code?


    (again, you *can* make Price/Calories abstract and 
    individually override)




- Sides have fewer overlapping features
    --> why even have a Side abstract class?




- Combo implements IMenuItem
    - EntreeChoice/SideChoice/DrinkChoice
    - defaults?
    - calories?
    - price?
