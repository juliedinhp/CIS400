Interfaces tutorial: due today
Inheritance tutorial: due Tuesday

Milestone 3: due Friday


--> make sure your solution builds
--> might need to update Visual Studio / get .NET 8.0


Paycom presentation about summer internships (with recruiter and recent K-State grad)
Thursday, September 12 in DUE 1116:
    1:05-1:15 Recruiter presentation
    1:20-1:50: Tech talk / Q&A
    1:50-2:00: K-State grad 

Let me (or Dr. Lang) know if you want to come and are NOT in CIS 415. They may
need to move to a bigger room.


///////////////////////

What goes in an interface?


What is the purpose?


naming convention?


//////////////////////

Example: Chicken and Dog

- what if we wanted a list of several chickens and dogs, 
    and to get the sound of each?

- what do they have in common? how could we refactor?

- how to use?



--> what does polymorphism mean?



Dog d = new Dog();
--> what types could store d?


//////////////////////

Implementing an existing interface.



Implementing multiple interfaces.


///////////////////////

(What are we going to do with our menu items?)

//////////////////////

Implicit casting vs explicit casting

double pi = 3.14;
int val = (int) pi; //implicit or explicit?


int num = 3;
double d = num; //implicit or explicit?



going from a more specific type to a less specific type

    lessSpecific = (need a cast?) moreSpecific;




going from a less specific type to a more specific type
   
       moreSpecific = (need a cast?) lessSpecific;



- examples with Dog/Animal

Dog d = (something);
IAnimal a = d;                  //OK?
                                //can we get the dog's name now?


IAnimal another = (something);
Dog d2 = another;               //OK?


///////////////////////////////////////////

as keyword

IAnimal animal = (something);
Dog dog = animal as Dog; //what will this do?



is keyword

IAnimal another = (something);
if (another is Dog d) {
    //what can we do here?
}

////////////////////////

Inheritance 

--> what is the idea? 


--> how is this different than interfaces?


--> when should we refactor to use inheritance?



What do we have to do when we extend a "regular" (non-abstract) class?
    public class Child : ParentClass

    what does child inherit?

    what does it have to do?



How do we override a method/property?
    1) in the parent, say: ???
    2) in the child, say: ???


Do we HAVE to override things?



/////////////////////

Purpose of an abstract class? 



Can an abstract class implement an interface?



What do we have to do when we extend an abstract class?
    public class Child : AbstractClass 

    -->what does Child inherit?


    -->what does it have to do?





///////////////////////////////


Can we implement more than one interface? 



Can we extend more than one abstract class?



Can we extend more than one "regular" class?


Does an abstract class have to have abstract methods/properties?


--> protected
    visibility: ??



////////////////////////////

--> how do constructors work with inheritance?
    
    Baby extends Parent, which extends Grandparent
    

   --> when are the different constructors called when we do:
   Baby e = new Baby();




--> what must a child constructor do if a parent constructor requires parameters?




--> different words for the "parent" class?




--> different words for the "child" class? 





////////////////////////

See example: Students


////////////////////////

See example: Shirts

- what is there in common?

- how to refactor?
